> "Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through. 
If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.
Our life is endless in the way that our visual field is without limit." - Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus

“I've never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life.” - Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet
